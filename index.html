        <p>
          I recently had the opportunity to visit the Grand Canyon. It was an
          awe-inspiring experience to witness the vastness and beauty of this
          natural wonder. The sheer size of the canyon and the stunning rock
          formations left me speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          From hiking along the rim to taking a helicopter tour, every moment
          was filled with wonder and excitement. I can't wait to go back and
          explore more of this incredible destination.

        <h2>Relaxing on the Beach in Hawaii</h2>
        <img src="./media/Hawaii Beach.jpeg" alt="Hawaii Beach" />
        <p>
          After a busy year, I decided to treat myself to a relaxing vacation in
          Hawaii. The pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and warm sunshine
          were just what I needed to recharge and rejuvenate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it was lounging on the sand, snorkeling in the ocean, or
          sipping cocktails at sunset, every moment in Hawaii was pure bliss.
          It's truly a paradise on earth, and I can't wait to return.
